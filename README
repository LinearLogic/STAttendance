#STAttendance
STAttendance is a program designed to aid in maintaining the upper school attendance records at Saint Albans School

##Graphical User Interface
The STAttendance GUI is designed using the Java Swing libraries and provides an intuitive and elegant way to access the
various features of the program.

##Database
The program maintains a flatfile database of teachers, classes, students, and various information for members of each
category. The contents of the database are updated based on received attendance email and can also be edited in the
"Database" tab.

##Mail Manager
Using a Gmail account authenticated at login, the program can dispatch attendance email to teachers listed in the
database and parse received messages to update the attendance records.

##Exporter
The contents of the STAttendance database can be written to a properly formatted flatfile in the "Export" tab in order
to be integrated into the EducationEdge backend.
